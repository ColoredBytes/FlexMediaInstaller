## :x: Problem

I have on my **GitHub** 3 separate repos for **Plex** ,**Emby**, and **Jellyfin**. I got to thinking though why not just converge them all into one? So when people want to install one of them they don't need to install clone 3 different repos. Unless That's what you're into.

## :heavy_check_mark: Solution

The Answer came to when I asked **ChatGPT** a simple question. 
- **What would be a good name for a Repo with a script that can install plex ,emby or jellyfin?**

As Usual, it spit out 10 answers but one stuck to me. FlexMediaInstaller. It stuck to me because this gives us the flexibility to install whatever media server we want. So I grabbed the 3 scripts I had made a whiptail menu for the front page and this **FlexMediaInstaller** was born.
